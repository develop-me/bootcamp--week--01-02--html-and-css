\subsection{Different image types}

\subsubsection{Raster (Bitmap)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{png} Has transparency, good compression, can be big
    \item \textbf{jpg} No transparency but smaller than png
    \item \textbf{tiff} No place on the web really
    \item \textbf{gif} Transparency, animation, small file size if icon based, incredibly big file size if animated.
    \item \textbf{webp} Google's new image format for the web. Incredibly good quality for compression. Not supported everywhere (check your picture element)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vector based}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{svg} Scalable (and actually code!)
\end{itemize}
