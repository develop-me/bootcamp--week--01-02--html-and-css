# Inspecting Elements

1. Change the class on the button with the text 'SELECT YOUR COURSE' `btn-primary` to `btn-danger` - Button turns red, bootstrap styling

2. Use the element picker tool to select the logo and change it's CSS height to `100px` - Element has an inline style, ideally they'll use the Styles tab to make the change

3. Remove the `<video>` playing in the background - what happens? - Image fallback should appear
