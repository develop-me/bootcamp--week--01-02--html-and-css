# Getting your website online

The purpose of this task is to get the webpage you have built online, so you (or anyone else) can access it from a browser, anywhere, on anything, at anytime.

To do this we need to put the files we used to build the website on a server.

We're going to be using cyberduck for this.

## Steps

1. Find the details that Oli has sent you, you should have been given a url, username & password
2. Open cyber duck
3. You will see a dialogue that's asks you these details, just put them in exactly as Oli has written them
...- host
...- username
...- password
4. Click connect and you will be connected to the server

> A server is just a computer that's available via the internet which holds all these website files and _serves_ (sends) them to a browser when it asks

5. The panel shows the files on the _server_
6. Copy all the files for the website from your computer to the server. You will have to navigate to your files & you can drag & drop.

> Don't copy the folder, copy the contents of the folder - so index.html and any other files & folders in the same place this file is

7. Now you can navigate to the website url Oli gave you and view your hard work!

## It's not working!

1. No connection? Make sure your username and password is correct. Speak to Oli to check
2. Files are not uploading? Refresh the panels
3. I can't see my website? Are you sure you have uploaded index.html directly
4. It's not styled/showing images. You need to make sure the paths are correct in your code
