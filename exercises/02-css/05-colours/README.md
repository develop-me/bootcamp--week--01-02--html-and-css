# CSS Colours

### Exercise 1

Colour your article page.

Use a hex code to colour the background of the article.

Use `rgb` to colour the text of your whole page. Make sure the text is still readable.

### Exercise 2

Instead of using the `button` element for styling, create a class and add it to the `button`, remember to update both your CSS and HTML so the button still looks the same

Now create another class which changes just the colour, so you can add and remove it from the button element depending on what colour you want
