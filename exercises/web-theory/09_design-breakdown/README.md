### Create a blueprint

Sketch out and annotate, note dimensions, colours, repeated styles, fonts, naming for classes later. https://www.figma.com/file/6TdVNL837VjTI7yvmiyKXf/Photography-Site-Student-Master?node-id=0%3A1

Good idea to choose one screen size to start.

Practise getting colours and fonts and once this is done you can start exporting images.
