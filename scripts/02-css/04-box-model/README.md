# CSS Box Model

---

### Every element on a webpage is basically a rectangle.

This is it's box - when we talk about the box model, we're talking about this box.

Pretty much all the layout properties affect this box, the size of it and where it is positioned.

Let's start with the basics.

---

### Every HTML element has a default set of styles

Let's have a look ðŸ‘€

Dev tools - show styles.

---

### Every element has a display property

One such style is the `display` property

Common default `display` values are `block` & `inline`

sectioning are block, text are inline

There are also media, table and list (item)

---

>The display property changes how the element behaves

---

### Let's try these properties

- `padding`
- `margin`
- `width`
- (sometimes) `height`
- both `min-` & `max-`
- `box-sizing`

Describe what each are - no need for height.

Show some padding on the header/article and box-sizing

Show these on inline

---

>You can change the display property

What happens if I change an inline element to `display: block`

---

There is a `display: inline-block` best of both worlds

- Check date
- Don't believe w3schools
- Use Stack Overflow with caution
