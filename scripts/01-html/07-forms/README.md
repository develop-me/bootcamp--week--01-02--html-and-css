There is no presentation as of yet, there never was.

Live code using the html file found in this directory

Explain how important forms are (all data passing) and how with just html & css you can only go so far (no interactivity)

Go over form structure, legends & fieldsets. Go through groups of form fields, paying special attention to attributes.
