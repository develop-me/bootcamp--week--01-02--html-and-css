# Some CSS I haven't mentioned

---

### Cursor

```css
/* little hand ðŸ‘† */
button {
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

There a quite a few different ones [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor)

You can put an image in

---

### List style

Shorthand ðŸ¤—

```css
ul {
    list-style: none;
}
```

For
- `list-style-type`
- `list-style-position`
- `list-style-image`

Easier to use a background image on list items for bullets

### Animations

Declare your animation (can be done anywhere in a CSS file)

```css
@keyframes move {
    0% {
        transform: translate(0px, 0px);
    }
    100% {
        transform: translate(50px, 50px);
    }
}
```

Use anywhere

```css
button {
    animation: move 1s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```
