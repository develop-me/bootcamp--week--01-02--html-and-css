# Design Breakdown

---

### Figma

Let's take a look at [Our Design](https://www.figma.com/file/6TdVNL837VjTI7yvmiyKXf/Photography-Site-Student-Master?node-id=0%3A1)

---

### Pages & Layers

Make sure sizes seem ok, have responsive designs

---

### Tools & Menus at top

---

### Select a layer

See information on right. NB check sub-layers. Things are grouped.

---

### Exercise

Get the colour of a component
Get the font of the header text

---

### Export panel & different image types

---

### Raster (Bitmap)

- png
	Has transparency, good compression, can be big
- jpg
	No transparency but smaller than png
- tiff
	No place on the web really
- gif
	Transparency, animation, small file size, incredibly big file size

---

### Vector based

- svg

> Scalable (and actually code!)

---

#### Exercise

### Create a blueprint

Sketch out and annotate, note dimensions, colours, repeated styles, fonts, naming for classes later.

Good idea to choose one size
