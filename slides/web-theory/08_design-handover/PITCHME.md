## Design: What to ask

[Our Design](https://www.figma.com/file/6TdVNL837VjTI7yvmiyKXf/Photography-Site-Student-Master?node-id=0%3A1)

### Different program files

- Photoshop (PSD)
- InDesign (INDD)
- Possibly Illustrator
- Sketch (not Adobe, mac only)
- Figma


Note:
Programme files: PS Will have layers to turn on and off access different elements separately. ID Vector files, layers, copy text, fonts. May include source images (links). Sketch: Super good at website & app. Vector based. Figma: We'll see

---

### Flat files ok...

- PDFs
	Good, vector-based, usually not lossy compression, often can copy text.
- PNGs
	Lossless.
- JPGs
	Lossy compression, difficult to get clean image from. Potentially different ‘colourspace’.

> We'll take about image formats later
