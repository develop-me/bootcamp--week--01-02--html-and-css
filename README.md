# HTML & CSS 1 & 2

HTML & CSS Syllabus for Develop Me: This covers both the first two modules of the fellowship.

### Overview

The first part is mainly based on theory lessons, learning HTML & CSS. Syntax, elements, style & layout, with supported exercises.

> If exercises are not held in directories, they are on codepen (this is a much easier set up for students in the early days). Codepen account is @devmeexamples (see BaseCamp -> Curriculum & Course Materials -> Docs & Files -> Weeks 1 & 2: HTML & CSS for login). It's worth looking through this account as there are plenty of other useful examples!

The second part is writing the templates for a multipage site. Theory includes how to approach a project, design handover, CSS methodology to structure your HTML & CSS well; we support the theory of component design and reuseable CSS

There are three categories taught in this course: HTML, CSS & Web Theory. The latter is for notes & lessons on accessibility, performance, testing, project planning & design theory.

### Folder structure

- exercises
    Each lesson contains exercises, here you will either find the code or the instructions for the students. After the first day the exercises build on from each other.
- notes
    These are the students notes - run LaTeX to generate the pdfs for the students
- quiz
    There is one for each week/part, but they are held in google docs, under the instructor account. Archive any previous quiz answers and then remove them from the form before distributing to new students
- scripts
    The tutors notes. We encourage live coding over slides.

### Notes for new tutors

Go through the repo - the slides folder especially. We teach in increments so you may feel valuable info is being omitted only to find it's being taught at a later stage. Don't overwhelm your students - remember you will have to lie until you can tell the truth.

If you are adding content: Choose your unit, create/modify slides, notes & exercises content as per. Things you may find useful:

You are responsible for marking the weekly quizzes.

## Suggested Course Structure

Feel free to mix and match the syllabus order as you see fit. This is proposed so you can keep track of where you have been and where you go next.

Order in the repo is as per category, not as per order in which you teach.

> I recommend printing off the table and making notes as you go as to what you have taught & amends

If you are splitting weeks with another tutor, make sure you make them aware of any material omitted from suggested 'Part One'. 'Part Two' depends on all theory being covered in the first part.

Once they get started on the weekly project it's a good idea to use some time during the days (Tues -> Thurs) to go over parts of the site with the class. I tend to pick out certain approaches or parts of the design they are struggling with. It varies for each class. You can [find the project on Glitch here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/infrequent-sugared-concavenator), (Instructor google verified account), it's usually in a state of incomplete, but this is helpful as showing coding is better than showing code.
